## THE ALMOST FINAL COUNTDOWN
"The Almost Final Countdown" is a game developed using React.js. All you need is a keen sense of time passing. The objective is to press the button based on the duration of seconds you want to predict and try to stop the timer when you feel you have reached the almost correct duration.
